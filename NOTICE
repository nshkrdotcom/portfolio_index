The derivation consists of architectural patterns, feature designs, and
implementation approaches analyzed from Arcana's codebase. No code was
directly copied, but the design of several components (RAG pipeline,
evaluation system, chunker utilities, telemetry patterns) was informed
by studying Arcana's implementation.

See docs/20251230/arcana_gap_analysis/ for the detailed analysis.
